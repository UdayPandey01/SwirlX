# SwirlX

**SwirlX** is a cross-chain bridge that enables users to transfer both ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFTs between EVM-compatible blockchains. It is built to demonstrate secure and seamless asset portability across chains through burn-and-mint or lock-and-release mechanisms. The project includes a modular smart contract system and a modern web interface for interaction.
